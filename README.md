# Analysis_of_Pokemon_Data

Pok√©mon are mysterious creatures with many secrets. I'm using the dataset that I've uploaded the data in this repository or you can access in this link : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Sc7_q52hxhKMEe-nyly_HXxbRzPpzWT/view 

I'm analyzed the pokemon data to fulfill the Data Science assignment in Digital Skill Fair 29.0 that held by dibimbing.id. I'm using Pokemon data from coach Octavian that was the coach of DSF 29.0 class at July 15th to 22nd, 2024.

## Insight :

1. Analyze data attributes of pokemon dataset.
2. Analyze statistical data of pokemon dataset.
3. Create visualizations of Pokemon Data.
4. Classification pokemon with each generation.
